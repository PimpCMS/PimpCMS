Welcome to PimpCMS


Congrats on getting set up!
Time to start writing. This file is in the /txts folder. Feel free to modify this file, or create new text files in the /txts folder. Any files created elsewhere will be ignored.
Formatting is easy. We use a simple heirarchy: one title, followed by any number of paragraphs, each with one topic sentence, followed by any number of supporting statements. Copy and paste this text into a text editor to see the exact formatting.

Why use this?
We believe you can build a message more effectively. Scattering your thoughts across separate bodies of text makes them hard to assess. We help you deliver your message to the world in a single, cohesive message.
Meaning takes time to refine. That's why we use Git to manage your content. Every update is like a new draft, and no draft is final. We hope you find the writing process simple and expressive.
